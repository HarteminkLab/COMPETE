# COMPETE

COMPETE: Competitive Occupancy: Multi-factor Profile Evaluation of a Thermodynamic Ensemble  COMPETE is licensed from Duke University.


## Note
Current version of the code here was written by Todd Wasson in the Hartemink Group for the following publication:

[Wasson, T. and Hartemink, A. J., 2009. An ensemble model of competitive multi-factor binding of the genome. Genome Res., 19(11):2101â€“2112.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19720867)

Further work has been done based on this code. Code was pushed into this repository by me so that those further work can be pushed into the same place later and be tracked appropriately.
